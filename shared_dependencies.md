1. **Scrapy**: All the files share the Scrapy framework as a dependency. Scrapy is used for web scraping in Python and is used across all the files for various purposes like defining the scraping rules, handling requests, and processing the scraped data.

2. **Items**: The "items.py" file defines the data schema for the scraped data. This schema is used in "reddit_scraper.py" and "reddit_spider.py" to structure the scraped data. It's also used in "pipelines.py" to process and store the data.

3. **Pipelines**: The "pipelines.py" file defines how the scraped data should be processed and stored. This is used in "reddit_scraper.py" and "reddit_spider.py" to send the scraped data for processing and storage.

4. **Settings**: The "settings.py" file contains various configuration settings for the Scrapy project. These settings are used across all the files to control the behavior of the Scrapy project.

5. **RedditSpider**: The "reddit_spider.py" file defines the RedditSpider class which contains the rules for scraping Reddit. This class is used in "reddit_scraper.py" to initiate the scraping process.

6. **Output.json**: The "output.json" file is the destination for the scraped data. The "pipelines.py" file uses this file to store the processed data.

7. **DOM Elements**: The specific DOM elements to be scraped from Reddit are defined in "reddit_spider.py" and used in "reddit_scraper.py" to extract the data.

8. **Scraped Data**: The data scraped from Reddit is shared between "reddit_spider.py", "pipelines.py", and "reddit_scraper.py". The data is scraped in "reddit_spider.py", sent to "pipelines.py" for processing, and then stored using "reddit_scraper.py".

9. **Scrapy Functions**: Functions like `parse`, `start_requests`, and `process_item` are shared across "reddit_spider.py", "pipelines.py", and "reddit_scraper.py" to handle the scraping, processing, and storage of data.
