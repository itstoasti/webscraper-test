The shared dependencies between the files we are generating are:

1. **Scrapy**: This is the main library used for web scraping in Python. It is used in all the files for various purposes like creating spiders, defining items, and setting up pipelines.

2. **GoogleSpider**: This is the name of the spider defined in "google_spider.py". It is used in "main.py" to start the scraping process.

3. **GoogleItem**: This is the data schema defined in "items.py". It is used in "google_spider.py" to structure the scraped data and in "pipelines.py" to process the scraped data.

4. **GooglePipeline**: This is the pipeline defined in "pipelines.py". It is used in "settings.py" to set up the item pipelines.

5. **Settings**: This is the configuration file for the Scrapy project. It is used in "main.py" to configure the Scrapy settings.

6. **JSON**: This is the format in which the scraped data is stored. It is used in "pipelines.py" to save the data.

7. **DOM Elements**: The id names of the DOM elements that the spider will interact with are shared between "google_spider.py" and "main.py". These might include elements like search results, pagination buttons, etc.

8. **Requests and Responses**: These are the messages exchanged between the spider and the website. They are used in "google_spider.py" to send requests and receive responses, and in "main.py" to handle the responses.

9. **Function Names**: Functions like parse, start_requests, etc. are defined in "google_spider.py" and used in "main.py". Similarly, functions like process_item are defined in "pipelines.py" and used in "settings.py".
